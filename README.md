📘 Policy Intelligence System – AI Powered Policy Search & Recommendation Engine

A complete AI-driven policy exploration, analytics, and recommendation platform built using Streamlit, Sentence-BERT, T5 transformer summarization, KeyBERT keyword extraction, UMAP + KMeans clustering, interactive India map visualizations, and more.

This system ingests policy data from policies2.json, auto-categorizes policies using NLP, enables advanced semantic search, offers personalized policy recommendations, and provides a full-featured Admin Dashboard for managing the policy dataset.

🚀 Key Features
🔎 1. AI Semantic Policy Search

Search policies using natural language (e.g.,
"loan for women entrepreneurs in Maharashtra").
Powered by:

Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) embeddings

Cosine similarity scoring

Multi-field semantic matching (title + summary + eligibility + benefits + tags)

🎯 2. AI Recommendation System

For any selected policy, the system recommends similar policies based on embeddings.
Useful for comparative analysis and policy exploration.

⚖️ 3. Policy Comparison Tool

Compare any two policies:

Semantic similarity score

Category comparison

Summary comparison

🧠 4. AI Eligibility Matcher

Users enter:

State

Age

Gender

Income

Social Category (GEN/OBC/SC/ST/EWS)

Disability

Then the system:

Computes semantic match score

Applies rule-based eligibility scoring

Produces a final AI Eligibility Score

Result:
✔ Best match
✔ Other matches
✔ Explanation for each match

✨ 5. Intelligent Auto-Category System (Multi-label)

Policies now get multiple categories, automatically assigned using:

Title keywords

Summary content

Tag keywords

Powered by a curated CATEGORY_KEYWORDS map.

🗺️ 6. Interactive India Map (Choropleth)

Visualizes policy count per state on an interactive map using:

GeoJSON of India states

Plotly choropleth map

Hover and zoom interactions

Helps admins understand state-level policy density.

📊 7. Admin Analytics Panel

The admin dashboard includes:

Total number of policies

Statewise distribution bar chart

Category-wise distribution

Data table view

JSON editing tools

Dataset management tools

Embedding rebuild support

📝 8. T5 Summarizer for Policies

Uses T5-small transformer to generate concise summaries for:

Long policy content

Eligibility + benefits

Great for readability and quick learning.

🔑 9. Keyword Extraction

Using KeyBERT to extract top keywords from each policy automatically.

📊 10. UMAP + KMeans Clustering

Dimensionality reduction and clustering:

Visual 2D scatterplot of policy clusters

Hover to see policy names

Helps identify category structures

Useful for data analysis & presentations

🎤 11. Voice-enabled Chatbot

Users can:

Speak queries via mic

Upload audio files

Convert speech to text

Get policy answers generated by AI

Hear audio output via TTS (gTTS)

🤖 12. Smart Chatbot

A GPT-like chatbot that:

Fetches top similar policies

Builds context

Generates answers from policy data

Returns concise, useful responses

📂 13. Admin Policy Management

Admins can:

Add Policy (JSON upload)

Delete Policy

Rebuild embeddings

View entire dataset

⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and Validate Policies

Policies are loaded from policies2.json and cleaned.

2. Category Auto-Detection

Each policy gets multiple categories via:

Keyword search

Tags

Fallback: “General”

3. SBERT Embedding Generation

Creates or loads embeddings.npy to speed up search & recommendations.

4. Admin Dashboard

Admins can manage the entire dataset + view analytics.

5. User Tools

Search, recommend, compare, cluster, summarize, match eligibility.
